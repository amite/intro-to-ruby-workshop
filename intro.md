# Intro

I want to start talking about how I learnt to program, how hard it was for me when I started 5 years ago.

I really enjoyed the front end technologies. I picked them up pretty fast. Took me six months. That was fast enough for me, I thought.

Then I just got hooked onto watching tutorials. I would watch a lot of them. Practice a few - get something going and then move on to something else.

While doing all this, I always felt like I was missing something. 

_Something was going on under the scenes_, behind the curtain. 

Things I knew I shouldn't really look at. 

Code!

Millions of blurry lines that looked green and scary. 

I could read some of it - like a function call, or a call to a jQuery plugin that would just magically make things move on the page. jQuery was the first real encounter I had with programming. You can grab something on a page and do something to it. That felt pretty powerful to me.

PHP was awesome. I still think it is. I can no other language that can get me connected to the web - _fast_.

Ruby arrived late - via rails. I saw the demos. I heard the buzz. I tried it out and I knew I was in love. It’s only after writing my first few programs with ruby that I decided that programming was for me.

Till then I just knew how to make websites with the latest CMSs and throw a thousand plugins in to make things look cool and flashy.

### I started to think like a programmer

So here is what ruby really did for me. It made me think! It showed me I could actually think. I just knew how to copy/paste things and get them working but then I learnt very late what I was actually doing and how it was working. 

Suddenly I was backstage and I knew that’s where I belonged. 

It made me think about what I was building rather than focusing on the material I was using to build it with. Like `for` loops and  semicolons and parens.
